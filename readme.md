Set Game
--------
The classic game of set. Written in Java. For my own personal enjoyment.

Rules
-----
There are 81 cards in a deck. A symbol, number, color, and shading is associated with each card.
A set is a group of three cards for which each attribute is the same or different for all three cards.

Use
---
Included is a runnable Set.jar file.

The game in its original form was designed by Set Enterprises, Inc. The card game can and should be bought [here](http://www.setgame.com/products "Set Game"). This is just a representation of that game for personal use only. This can be modified and redistributed but should not be used for monetary gain.
